# Internet Speed Twitter Complaint Bot

Selenium bot that measures internet speed via M-Lab and tweets at your ISP when speeds fall below the promised thresholds.

When your ISP promises 150 Mb/s download and 10 Mb/s upload, this bot opens M-Lab's NDT7 speed test in a real Chrome browser, waits for the results, extracts your actual download and upload speeds, and—if they're below the promised values—composes and posts a tweet such as: *"Hey Internet Provider, why is my internet speed 42.3down/3.1up when I pay for 150down/10up? #ISP #InternetSpeed"*. No manual steps are needed after the first run.

This project ships in two builds. The **original build** follows the course approach: it kills all Chrome processes, launches a fresh Chrome instance with remote debugging enabled, attaches Selenium to that debugger session, and posts the tweet through your already-logged-in browser profile. The **advanced build** refactors the logic into clean, separated modules using `undetected-chromedriver` with a persistent profile, centralises all selectors and constants in `config.py`, and guards every browser interaction with proper JS-click fallbacks and short timeouts.

No external API keys are required. Both builds use browser automation against the public M-Lab speed-test page and Twitter's web UI. Twitter login is performed manually on first run; subsequent runs reuse the saved browser session.

## 0. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Python 3.10+ | Required for modern type hints |
| Google Chrome | Advanced build auto-manages ChromeDriver via UC |
| Twitter / X account | Log in once manually in the opened browser window |
| Internet connection | Bot measures your real connection speed |

No Twitter API keys needed — the bot interacts with the Twitter web UI directly.

---

## 1. Quick start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/xavier-oc-programming/internet-speed-twitter-bot.git
cd internet-speed-twitter-bot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the menu
python menu.py
```

On first run, Chrome opens and navigates to Twitter. Log in manually. The session is saved to the persistent profile — subsequent runs skip the login step.

Update `CHROME_VERSION` in `advanced/config.py` to match your installed Chrome major version if UC raises a version mismatch error.

## 2. Builds comparison

| Feature | Original | Advanced |
|---|---|---|
| Browser driver | `selenium.webdriver.Chrome` + remote debugging | `undetected-chromedriver` + persistent profile |
| Architecture | Single script | `config.py` + `bot.py` + `main.py` |
| Constants | Inline | Centralised in `config.py` |
| XPaths | Inline | Grouped in `config.py` by page area |
| JS click fallback | Partial | All non-trivial clicks |
| Error handling | `try/except` with prints | Raises `RuntimeError`; orchestrator catches |
| Twitter login | Manual via debugger session | Manual on first run; persistent profile reused |
| Threshold check | Always tweets | Only tweets if speeds are below promised |

## 5. Features

### Both builds
- Runs the M-Lab NDT7 speed test in a real Chrome browser
- Accepts the data-sharing consent checkbox via JavaScript click
- Waits up to 180 seconds for test completion
- Extracts download and upload speeds from the results table
- Builds a complaint tweet with actual vs promised speeds
- Posts the tweet using clipboard paste (handles special characters)

### Advanced build only
- Only tweets if speeds are actually below promised thresholds
- All selectors, URLs, and constants in one file (`config.py`)
- Persistent Chrome profile — Twitter session survives across runs
- `undetected-chromedriver` avoids bot-detection fingerprinting
- JS-click fallback on every browser interaction
- Clean class-based architecture with separated concerns
- Raises exceptions on failure instead of silent exits

## 10. Environment variables

No API keys are required. This bot uses browser automation only.

If you want to parameterise the ISP thresholds, you can add a `.env` file:

```
PROMISED_DOWN=150
PROMISED_UP=10
```

And read them via `os.getenv()` in `config.py`. The `.env` file is gitignored.

---

## 11. Design decisions

**`undetected-chromedriver` over `selenium.webdriver.Chrome`**
Standard ChromeDriver is fingerprinted and blocked by many modern login systems. UC patches the Chrome binary to remove automation signatures, which helps with Twitter's bot-detection.

**`CHROME_VERSION` pinned in `config.py`**
UC needs the exact major version to download the correct driver patch. Update this constant whenever Chrome auto-updates.

**`ChromeOptions` prefs for permissions**
Chrome's native permission dialogs (notifications) are OS-level and cannot be clicked by Selenium XPath. Setting `notifications: 2` in ChromeOptions prefs suppresses them before they appear.

**JS click with normal click fallback**
Overlapping elements, animations, and edge-of-viewport positions all cause `ElementClickInterceptedException`. Every non-trivial click uses `_js_click()` which tries normal click first and falls back to `driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", el)`.

**Clipboard paste (`pyperclip` + Cmd+V) instead of `send_keys(text)`**
Twitter's React-based tweet box ignores `send_keys()` for long or special-character strings. Copying to clipboard and pasting is the only reliable method.

**Persistent Chrome profile over remote debugging**
The course original uses remote debugging (launch Chrome externally, attach Selenium). The advanced build uses UC with a persistent profile directory instead. This means: no need to kill Chrome first, no need to launch a separate process, and the session is preserved between Python runs.

**Threshold check before tweeting**
The advanced build only posts a tweet if the measured speeds are actually below the promised thresholds, avoiding spam if your connection is performing fine.

**`SPEED_TEST_SETTLE` sleep after results appear**
M-Lab renders the results header before populating the speed table. Without a 6-second settle, the XPaths find empty cells.

**All XPaths in `config.py`**
Twitter and M-Lab both change their DOM periodically. Centralising all selectors means a broken XPath requires changing exactly one line.

## 12. Course context

**Course:** 100 Days of Code — The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp  
**Day:** 51  
**Topic:** Browser automation with Selenium — intermediate project  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate (Selenium, remote debugging, UI automation)

The key insight from this day is that automating login-protected sites (Twitter, Google) is hard because they actively detect and block bots. The course solution sidesteps this by using Chrome's remote debugging protocol to attach Selenium to a browser session where the user is already logged in — a practical real-world pattern.
